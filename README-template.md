## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS/CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

First of all this is the first React app that i made by myself. I had followed a couple of tutorials about
React last year but never started a project on my own. So when i saw this challenge i thought it was a good
way to start learning React again.

- Learned about how to use "prop-types"
- Learned more about how to make use of components
- React workflow

### Continued development

- Folder structure
- Components
- State
- Context/redux
- API
